# Panzer-list-parser
## What is a panzer list?
A panzer list is a JSON file made by the [tf2_bot_detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector) project,  
its supposed to be used to kick people ingame that are using cheats in Team fortress 2,  
 especially ones that are automated bots.

## What is this for?
This is for checking and downloading all panzer lists (also community ones) available  
and be able to search them trough to see if somebody added you to one of their lists  

## TODO:
- [ ] Download the JSON files automatically.
   - [ ] Check if they have already been downloaded & up to date.
- [ ] Make them searchable
- [ ] Add cli commands to plp (panzer-list-parser)
- [ ] Make them searchable using multiple accounts in an json file
- [ ] Combine all json files into one and put it onto github via an workflow
